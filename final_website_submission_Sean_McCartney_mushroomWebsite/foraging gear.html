    <p>The main things you need are a knife and something to put the mushrooms into once picked.  The other items listed above are optional; however; a good field guide is strongly recommended.
       And, of course, always be mindful of what the conditions are outside.  Will you need a rain coat?  What about insect or tick repellant?  <br><br>The second list
       on this page has "gear" to be used if you wish to cultivate mushrooms.  The internet is full of information if you want to transplant spores and grow your own mushrooms!
       There are many edible mushrooms that can be cultivated and others that are more tricky due to various and sometimes unknown factors.  Again, do some research if this is something
        you might be interested in.  For those of us who are lazy, there are commercially available kits online.  Years back, I bought a kit for Lion's Mane, a delicious edible mushroom prized for it's medicinal benefits.</p><hr><br><br><br>

    <p>&emsp;* Paper bags or wicker baskets are excellent collecting containers for mushrooms.  Plastic bags are less ideal, but will work fine as long as they aren't in them too long.</p>
