	<h2>Introduction</h2>
    	<p>Mushrooms are all around us!  Fungi are one of the most overlooked of the biological kingdoms.  They provide value to people in so many different ways ranging from a food source, medicine, as well as other unexpected uses such as kindling material and psychopharmaceutical implications.  For the most part, we will be exploring some of the common mushrooms that can be foraged in the eastern part of the United States.</p><hr>

	<h2>Growing Conditions</h2>              
		<p id="growing_condtions">Mushrooms grow in all sorts of conditions; however, they typically grow in moist conditions.  Unlike plants, they cannot produce their own food- they need to get sustenance another way.  Some mushrooms get their energy from dead organic material in the soil or from other dead material such as a decomposing log.</p><img class="dead_log" src="pictures/deadlog.jpg" alt="dead log"><hr>

    <h2>Foraging</h2>

	    <p>Chances are you've already foraged for mushrooms sometime in the past.  Ever found an interesting looking mushroom in woods and picked it before tossing it back on the ground?
If so, congratulations, you are a wild mushroom forager.  To become better at foraging, there are some things to consider.  Are the conditions good for foraging?
Is there a specific mushroom you are looking for?  Like everything in life post 2010, these and every other question you might have can be answered by a quick Google search.
	<br><br>Before you go out, you'll want to have the proper gear.  At a minimum, you'll need a knife and a bag/container.  Click <!--insert an "a" tag for the word "here"--> here 
for a more in depth list of foraging gear.  Keep your eyes peeled.  Being intentional with your searching is a plus.  Mushrooms are not like plants.  you won't damage the ecosystem or
the mushroom when you pick it.  Mushrooms, in general, are the fruiting bodies of fungi.  They WANT you to pick them as it disperses spores.  Mushrooms don't have roots.  They have mycelium, which
is more pervasive than roots and has a level of structure that is closer to being cellular than a larger, functioning unit.  Aka, it is harder to destroy the individual fungus.
	<br><br>Identification of mushrooms can be difficult but don't worry.  A lot of times, there is no expert consensus of what species a mushroom is.  A search on the internet is helpful.  A guidebook
is even better.  It is helpful to be specific when identifying mushrooms.  What do the gills look like, what does the stipe (mushroom talk for "stem") look like, what color are the different parts of the
mushroom? You can be as specific as you want to be.  For example, when looking at the gills of a mushroom, you can make note of how close they are to each other and how they are attached to the stipe.
When looking at the margin (the outside border of the mushroom's cap), pay attention to whether it is flat or curved.  Is there anything unique about the cap?  What is it like around where you found the
mushroom?  What trees and plants are growing nearby.  Did you find it in a field, the woods, in a marshy area, has there been a lot of rain recently or has it been kind of dry out lately?  These are a lot
of things to consider.  You can be as specific in your observations as you want to be.  The important thing is to keep your sanity.  If it is no longer fun because you are obsessing over every detail, you
are not obligated to give yourself OCD.
	<br><br>When foraging, especially when new to this hobby, it is CRUCIAL to err on the side of caution.  When in doubt, don't eat it!  Like most things, it is a good idea to learn from an actual person.
You can self teach yourself; however, it is not preferrable.  &emsp;Remember mushrooms are not like plants.  You won't have any allergic reactions by touching a mushroom.  Only
ingestion can cause problems.</p><hr><br><br><br>

	<h2 class="mushrooms_to_be_found">So...  What Types of Mushrooms Are There?</h2>

		<p>I'm glad you asked...<br><br>  There are <em>"The Good"</em>, <em>"The Bad"</em>, and <em>"The Ugly"</em>.      <em><a href="the_good.html">"The Good"</a></em> are edible and medicinal (non-psychoactive)
		mushrooms.  Most of the time, these are what foragers are trying to find.  If one is so inclined, we could put inedible, nonpoisonous mushrooms in this category as well.  
		Why not?  Some people pick mushrooms just for the beauty of them.  <em>"The Good"</em> would include many of the shelf-like mushrooms, fleshy mushrooms, and so 
		many others.<br><br>  <em><a href="the_bad.html">"The Bad"</a></em> are mushrooms that are poisonous.  The majority of mushrooms out there are harmless but some are not.  Their toxicity can be severe- effecting
		hepatic and renal functions.  Others are more benign but still considered toxic.  The latter of these "bad" mushrooms can give you mild to moderate symptoms such as stomach 
		cramps.<br><br>  <em><a href="the_ugly.html">"The Ugly"</a></em> are mushrooms that are highly toxic and potentially deadly.  For the most part, these mushrooms affect hepatic (liver) and renal 
		(kidney) functioning.  Not to be a downer, but the consequences of ingestion are dire.  Dying from them involves a slow and painful process.  As far as I know,
		some of them have no known antedote.  However, others, as previously are less "terminal"  but will still give the person who consumed them issues.  <em>"The Ugly"</em> 
		are mushrooms that have miscellaneous side effects.  These include hallucinogenic mushrooms, mushrooms that have other psychoactive properties, and mushrooms that
		are poisonous when consumed with alcohol.</p><br><br>Thanks for taking the time to check out this website.  Mushrooms are a unique kingdom--mysterious, fun, and full of wonder.  For more information, click <a href="additional_resources.html">here</a>.<p><hr><hr><hr>
